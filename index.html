        "I had a disc herniation in my neck and had to have surgery. I was in excruciating pain. After only three
        acupuncture sessions with Josie, the pain subsided! I was able to get off pain medications. Josie approaches
        health from all viewpoints - mind, body, and spirit. She is a natural healer and I will be eternally grateful to
        her."

      <blockquote>
        "When I first came to see Josie, Western doctors had told me that there was no further treatment they could give
        me to help relieve the pain in my arthritic foot. The pain was interfering in my work and my training in martial
        arts. Through acupuncture, herbal treatments, and continual work with Josie, I am now free of foot pain.
        Acupuncture treatments help me with my stress, my way of seeing my body, and give me an overall sense of
        well-being. Josie Zhuo is a tremendously skilled physician and a delightful person! I look forward to my
        sessions and continuing to learn more about Chinese medicine and energy."

        "I came to Josie for my symptoms of seasonal affective disorder. My mood and energy were low, especially on grey
        days. Josie is a miracle worker! Beginning the first week of treatment I saw a dramatic increase in my mood and
        energy. I am so grateful. I am telling everyone I know about Josie."

        "Josie's Qi Gong/Tai Chi class has been an inspiration. It truly helps me feel the mind/body/spirit connection,
        especially because of the teaching of Josie. Her gentle, wise, and warm guidance has helped make a difference in
        my life. I look forward to Josie's class and hope that she continues to teach for many years!"

      <blockquote>
        "For the last two years I have been having a nagging stomach discomfort at night. The sensation is bloating, as
        if gas cannot release. I have consulted many doctors and specialists, but no one could help me. The diagnosis
        they all agreed on is: IBS. The discomfort affected my quality of life—after the discomfort flared at night I
        could only sleep for four hours and felt overwhelmed as I'm also a new mom. A dear friend recommended Josie.
        After only a few treatments, my digestion and overall health improved. Josie's stress-relief and self-massage
        techniques, meditation, and herbs are effective. My stomach and body are getting stronger. Josie Zhuo is truly a
        healing master."

        "Josie Zhuo is a compassionate healer and master. Her acupuncture treatments and teachings improve my life in
        myriad ways. I no longer experience chronic shoulder pain or take daily medication and my anxiety after quitting
        smoking is diminished. Josie inspires me to practice Tai Chi/Qi Gong every day—movements that empower
        self-healing, rid blockages, and generate Qi energy passing through my body. She builds bridges connecting the
        physical and spiritual worlds by sharing Chinese traditions and philosophy in a gentle, yet powerful holistic
        way."

        skilled practitioner, she has a very open and accessible personality and she teaches you how to care for

        "I came to Dr. Josie after battling infertility for one year. I had tried various routes of treatment, including
        Western Medicine. My western doctor insists that I would not get pregnant without the help of the fertility
        drugs. I was convinced that this was not true and continued on the quest. Dr. Josie's calming words of
        encouragement and acupuncture really made me believe that my body was ready. And sure enough, one and a half
        months after treatment, I'm pregnant! Dr. Josie is truly a miracle worker."
